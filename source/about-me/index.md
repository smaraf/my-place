# Who am I?

My name is Smara and I'm a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/smaranda-fournier/). I like working with people and solving problems. I do my best to [share](/blog) what I learn or what gets me excited.

## What I've been doing lately

* I started volunteering with [Code for BTV](http://codeforbtv.org/) on the [Green Up Vermont](https://www.greenupvermont.org/) project.
* I've been practicing my coding skills on [CodeFights](https://codefights.com/signup/wrzsSQnyvxaBfEoXa/main)
