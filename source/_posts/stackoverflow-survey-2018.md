# The Stack Overflow Developer Survey Results for 2018

I came across [these](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/) today as I was starting my day. I think it's exciting to understand what the trends are in our world.

One big question that now echoes in my head is: where are all the women? According to the [survey](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#developer-profile-gender), only 6.8% of all respondents were female. I now have more questions. Where are all the other ones? Are they silent? Are they not on Stack Overflow?

I don't have any answers today.
