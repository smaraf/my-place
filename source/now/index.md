I recently moved to the [Burlington, VT](https://goo.gl/maps/L61r6ce6h9E2) area and it's cold here. I'm still enjoying my sabbatical.

I practice my coding skills on CodeFights. Join me using my [referral link](https://codefights.com/signup/wrzsSQnyvxaBfEoXa/main). Be careful, it's addictive!

I contribute to the [Green Up App](http://codeforbtv.org/projects/greenup-app/) project.

I learn React.

I'm looking for my next adventure as a software engineer.
