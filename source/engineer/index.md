I like solving problems.

I am fluent in C#, JavaScript, PowerShell, SQL, HTML, CSS.

I have experience with all phases of the dev cycle, from analysis and planning to setting up a deployment pipeline and deploying to production.

I like building teams.

I believe in remote work.

I think all software engineers should read:

* Clean Coder by Robert C. Martin
* The Phoenix Project by Gene Kim, George Spafford, and Kevin Behr
